## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and an API key for the following service:

*   **Google Gemini**: Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your free API key.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/visual-assistant-ai.git
    cd visual-assistant-ai
    ```

2.  **Set up API Keys:**

    The application is hardcoded to look for API keys in `process.env`. Since this is a browser-based project without a build step, you need to make these keys available. A simple way is to use a local web server that can replace these placeholders.

    **Example using `npx` and a helper script:**

    a. Create a setup script, for example `setup-dev.js`:
       ```javascript
       // setup-dev.js
       const fs = require('fs');
       const path = require('path');

       const geminiApiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
       if (!geminiApiKey) {
         console.error('Error: GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable must be set.');
         process.exit(1);
       }

       // Inject Gemini Key
       const geminiServicePath = path.join(__dirname, 'services', 'geminiService.ts');
       let geminiServiceContent = fs.readFileSync(geminiServicePath, 'utf8');
       geminiServiceContent = geminiServiceContent.replace(
         `process.env.API_KEY`,
         `'${geminiApiKey}'`
       );
       fs.writeFileSync(geminiServicePath, geminiServiceContent);
       console.log('Successfully injected Gemini API key.');
       ```
    b. Run the script before starting your server. Replace the placeholder with your actual key.
       ```sh
       # For Windows
       set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE
       
       # For macOS/Linux
       export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE"
       
       node setup-dev.js
       ```
    c. Serve the project root:
       ```sh
       npx serve
       ```

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate to the address provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    *   **IMPORTANT**: For camera and microphone access, your browser requires a secure context (`https://`). Most local server tools provide this. With `serve`, you can often access it via `https://localhost:3000` (you may need to accept a browser security warning).
